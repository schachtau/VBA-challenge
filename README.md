Module 2 Challenge 
I have built a VBA script that loops through stocks for a period of time, in this case a year and yields valuable information for traders such as the highest price versus the lowest price of the year, Yearly percent change, total volume of the stock and most importantly, 3 stocks: Stock with the greatest yearly percentage increase in value (YDI) at 188.76%, the stock with the greatest yearly decrease in value (VNG) at -89.05% and finally the stock with the most volume YTD with an amazing 3,452,960,000,000 trades was (QKN). This information was for 2020 but has been used in 2019 and 2018. This loop makes it easy to make sense of a massive amount of data and make informed decisions.
